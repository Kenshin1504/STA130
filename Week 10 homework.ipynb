    "Simple Linear Regression is a statistical technique that models the relationship between a single predictor variable 𝑋 and a response (dependent) variable 𝑌 by fitting a linear equation $Y= β_0 + β_1X + ϵ$. It is best suited when there is one main factor influencing the outcome and the goal is to understand this singular relationship.\n",

    "Multiple Linear Regression is an extension of simple linear regression that models the relationship between multiple predictor variables $𝑋_1, 𝑋_2, …, 𝑋_𝑛$ and the response variable 𝑌. The equation takes the form $Y= β_0 + β_1X_1 + ... +  β_2X_2 + β_nX_nϵ$. It is deal for scenarios where multiple factors may affect the outcome. It allows for analyzing the individual effect of each predictor while controlling for others. \n",

    "R-squared is a measure of the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the model. It provides a sense of how well the model as a whole captures the variability of the outcome. In this case, the low R-squared value of 0.176 suggests that there is still substantial variation in HP that remains unaccounted for by the included predictors. The model is likely omitting other important predictors which have an impact on HP. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, p-values test the null hypothesis that each individual coefficient is equal to zero (i.e., a particular predictor has no effect on the outcome). The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis, suggesting that the predictor is likely to have a statistically significant effect on the outcome. Several coefficients have low p-values and relatively large magnitudes (particularly the coefficients for Generation levels, with the exception of `C(Generation)[T.5]`). This implies that these predictors are significantly associated with HP when controlling for other predictors. \n",
    "\n",

    "The bottom line is that R-squared and p-values are not inherently contradictory; they address complementary aspects of model evaluation. While some predictors have a detectable impact on HP, these effects do not collectively account for much of HP's total variability. There are likely other important predictors that the model is currently missing, which leads to a low R-squared value."

MLR extends this by including multiple predictors, capturing more complexity in the relationships and providing a better model fit.\n",
    "2. Continuous vs. Indicator Variables in Linear Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic: We explored how linear regression models change based on whether a predictor variable is continuous or binary (indicator). Continuous predictors result in linear trends, while binary variables can shift the regression intercept without changing the slope. I provided linear forms with LaTeX code for representing both types.\n",
    "3. Adding Interaction Terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic: We examined how adding interaction terms to an MLR model allows the effect of one predictor to vary depending on another predictor. This is especially useful when variables like advertising channels might affect each other’s impact on the outcome. I shared how interaction terms alter linear forms and model predictions.\n",
    "4. Using Only Indicator Variables in MLR:\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic: When using only indicator variables (derived from a non-binary categorical variable), we discussed how each indicator adjusts the model for specific categories relative to a reference. This requires binary (0/1) encoding for each category, minus one reference, yielding a model that estimates distinct intercepts for each group.\n",
    "5. Logistic Regression Setup for Mental Health Prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic: Your specific logistic regression question involved predicting self-rated mental health (converted to binary). With age as a continuous predictor and gaming frequency as a categorical predictor, I outlined how to construct the linear form for this logistic model, including the conversion of mental health categories into a binary outcome variable.\n",
    "6. Logistic Regression Code in Python using statsmodels:\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic: I provided Python code using statsmodels.formula.api to perform logistic regression, covering data setup (binary encoding for mental health and indicator encoding for game frequency), model fitting, and output interpretation.\n",
    "7. Explanation of Predictions Using Models with and Without Interaction Terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic: For your final question on prediction differences in models with and without interaction terms, I explained how interaction terms modify model interpretation, enabling predictions that reflect combined effects of variables (e.g., TV and online advertising together rather than separately).\n",

    "The specification of model4_linear_form in the code uses interaction terms (e.g., Attack * Defense * Speed * Legendary * Q(\"Sp. Def\") * Q(\"Sp. Atk\")), which create new predictor variables representing combinations of the original features. When the formula is applied, statsmodels generates a \"design matrix,\" accessible as model4_spec.exog, where each column represents one of these newly created predictors, such as individual terms (Attack, Defense) or interactions (e.g., Attack:Defense, Attack:Defense:Speed). These predictors collectively form the input variables that the model uses to predict the outcome (HP), represented in model4_spec.endog.\n",

    "**How Multicollinearity Affects Generalizability**\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity occurs when two or more predictor variables in the design matrix are highly correlated, meaning they carry redundant or overlapping information. \n",
    "\n",
    "**_1. High Correlation Between Predictors_**\n",
    "\n",
    "When two predictor variables are highly correlated, it becomes difficult for the model to distinguish their individual contributions to the outcome. This is because the parameters are measured as the effect of one predictor on the outcome while holding all other predictors constant. High correlation between predictors makes it difficult to isolate this effect, since increasing one predictor would mean another predictor is bound to change as a result. This overlap introduces instability in the model’s estimates because small changes in the data can lead to significant shifts in the estimated coefficients. As a result, while the model may fit well on the training data (\"in-sample\" performance), it often fails to generalize to new data (\"out-of-sample\" performance) because the learned relationships are too dependent on the specifics of the training dataset rather than capturing the true underlying patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_2. High Multicollinearity Across Multiple Predictors_**\n",
    "\n",
    "When multiple predictor variables are highly multicollinear, the problem compounds, making it nearly impossible to assign reliable and stable coefficients to each predictor. The model may achieve a high \"in-sample\" R-squared due to the overfitting caused by redundant predictors, but this does not translate into reliable predictive power on new data. Instead, the model becomes overly sensitive to noise and fluctuations in the training set, undermining its \"out-of-sample\" performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This highlights why \"in-sample\" versus \"out-of-sample\" performance is crucial in evaluating model evidence. While hypothesis testing of coefficients can indicate if predictors are significantly associated with the outcome in the given dataset, \"out-of-sample\" metrics assess whether these associations hold up in unseen data, directly addressing the model’s generalizability. In models with high multicollinearity, the unreliable estimates and poor generalizability reflect a lack of robust evidence for the predictive associations in the dataset, as any patterns detected are likely artifacts of the training data rather than meaningful insights.\n",
    "\n",

    "model5_linear_form is an additive model which builds on model3_fit, which has a simple structure with only two predictors: Attack and Defense, for the outcome HP. model5_linear_form adds more predictors to improve the model's explanatory power, considering more potential factors that influence HP. We also take into account the issues with model4_fit which includes several interaction terms, consequently leading to multicollinearity, potential overfitting and difficulties with generalizability. To improve the model, model5 simplifies the structure by removing these interactions while still including important variables that may have main effects on HP. `Generation`, `Type 1`, and `Type 2` are treated as categorical variables to handle them as factors in model5_linear_form.\n",

This was done by removing coefficients with high p-values in model5_linear_form. Variables `Type 1` and `Generation` are retained, but only those levels that were statistically significant in model5_linear_form (such as Normal and Water for Type 1, and generations 2 and 5). The model removes predictors like `Defense` and `Legendary` that did not appear to contribute significantly to the outcome. This refines the model by removing irrelevant variables and strengthening it with more meaningful predictors, improving \"out-of-sample\" generalization.\n",

By repeatedly training the model on different subsets of the data and evaluating its performance on unseen test data, we can better understand how well the model generalizes and whether it overfits to the training data.\n",

This repetition helps assess the model’s robustness to different data subsets.\n",

However, an excessively high value could suggest overfitting, meaning the model is too specialized to the training data and may not generalize well.\n",

The line y = x serves as a reference for perfect consistency between in-sample and out-of-sample performance. If the points are near this line, the model is generalizing well. Points scattered far from the line suggest high variance in performance, indicating that the model’s generalizability might be inconsistent."

    "Overfitting typically happens when the model is too complex and closely follows the training data, failing to generalize to new, unseen data. In this case, we would expect a high in-sample R-squared (good fit on training data) but a low out-of-sample R-squared (poor generalization to test data). Underfitting happens when the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, leading to both low in-sample and low out-of-sample R-squared values.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the scatter plot above, points below the $y = x$ line indicate overfitting. However, points above this line indicate a different type of variability in performance across repeated train-test splits that is not about underfitting, since their out-of-sample R-squared is relatively high. This may be due to sampling variability. In certain train-test splits, the training data may not be fully representative of the broader data distribution, especially in smaller datasets. This can result in an in-sample R-squared that is artificially lower due to the training data being skewed or having outliers that are not present in the test data. Conversely, if the test data is more balanced or representative of the full distribution, the model might generalize surprisingly well to this more representative test set, yielding a higher out-of-sample R-squared.\n",

    "`model7_gen1_predict_future` trains model7 on Generation 1 data, then tests it on the remaining generations (2-6). The original 'In sample' R-squared  indicates that model7 explains about 38% of the variance within its training data. However, on the out-of-sample data, its predictive ability drops dramatically, suggesting poor generalizability. When using Generation 1 to predict future Generations, model7 performs better in-sample when fitted only on Generation 1, explaining about 57% of the variance within that generation alone. However, its out-of-sample R-squared when predicting on Generations 2-6 remains low, suggesting that the model's structure may be tailored to specific patterns in Generation 1 that do not extend well to other Generations."

The original in-sample and out-of-sample R-squared values are identical to those of the model7 above trained only on Generation 1 data. However, this time the 'Out of sample' R-squared value is comparatively higher than the one seen in Code block 1. This suggests that training on Generations 1 to 5 provides a broader base of information, capturing more general patterns that extend into Generation 6.
