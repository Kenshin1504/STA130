    "**Research Question #1:** Is there a correlation among Canadians between burnout levels and feelings of loneliness?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables:**\n",

    "Predictor: WELLNESS_malach_pines_burnout_measure_score\n",
    "\n",
    "Outcome: LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_score\n",
    "\n",
    "Burnout and loneliness both affect personal well-being and the quality of social connections. Since both WELLNESS_malach_pines_burnout_measure_score and LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_score are numerical variables, a scatter plot may be appropriate, allowing for a visual assessment of any correlation and outliers in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**\n",
    "An Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) simple linear regression model will be used to find a best-fitting line with WELLNESS_malach_pines_burnout_measure_score predicting LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_score. This will give us the test statistic for the slope coefficient, which can be used to calculate the p-value for the test statistic. After setting an $\\alpha$-significance level, the p-value can be calculated through permutation testing to generate a sampling distribution of slope coefficients under the null hypothesis. We assume linearity, independence of observations as well as independence, homoscedasticity and normality of the errors, which should have a mean of zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypotheses:**\n",
    "Null hypothesis ($H_0$): There is no linear association between burnout levels and feelings of loneliness    ($β_1 = 0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$): There is a linear association between  burnout levels and feelings of loneliness ($β_1 \\not= 0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Statistically significant positive association: The p-value is less than the $\\alpha$-significance level and the test statistic is positive.\n",
    "2. Statistically significant negative association: The p-value is less than the $\\alpha$-significance level and the test statistic is negative. \n",
    "3. No statistically significant association: The p-value is greater than the $\\alpha$-significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results will determine whether a person's burnout level is positively, negatively or not linearly associated with their feelings of loneliness.\n",

    "**Research Question #2**\n",
    "Is there an association between the number of hours Canadians work per week and the amount of time per week they would like to spend socializing with family members?\n",

    "**Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictor: WORK_hours_per_week\n",
    "\n",
    "Outcome: CONNECTION_preference_time_family_grouped\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of hours worked can influence people's physical as well as mental well-being. The amount of time people would like to spend socializing with family members can be a measure of people's feelings of loneliness and desire for social connections. Kernel density estimation (KDE) plots can be used to visualise the modality and distribution of both variables, which are of numeric nature. KDE plots offer an aesthetically pleasing and smooth initial representation of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**\n",
    "Using observations with non-missing values from the the CSCS data, an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) simple linear regression model will be used to find a best-fitting line with WORK_hours_per_week predicting CONNECTION_preference_time_family_grouped. A 95% confidence interval will be constructed for the slope coefficient ($β_1$) using bootstrapped resampling. We assume linearity, independence of observations as well as independence, homoscedasticity and normality of the errors, which should have a mean of zero. \n",

    "\n",
    "Predictor: DEMO_age\n",
    "\n",
    "Outcome: WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_happy\n",
    "\n",
    "DEMO_age is a numeric variable referring to the age of each person taking the CSCS survey. WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_happy is a value from 1 to 7 representing each person's self-reported perception of being a happy person, 1 being least happy and 7 being the happiest. These variables may hint at whether age is associated with emotional well-being and the extent to which age is an important factor when determining how far forming social connections impacts happiness. A Kernel density estimation (KDE) plot can be used to visualise the modality and distribution of participants' ages, which are of continuous nature. KDE plots offer an aesthetically pleasing and smooth initial representation of the data. A bar plot may be used to visualise the frequency with which participants chose each value on the happiness scale, which would offer visual clarity and an easily understandable representation of the data.\n",
